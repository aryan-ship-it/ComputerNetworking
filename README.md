# TCP/IP Message Stack Encapsulation
This README provides an overview of TCP/IP message stack encapsulation, including its purpose, components, and how it works

**Purpose**

Encapsulating TCP/IP message stacks is a technique for ensuring dependable networked device communication. It divides data into tiny packets that may be sent over the network and put back together at the other end. Each packet gains headers during the encapsulation process, which contain data required for delivery and routing.

**Components**

Application layer: This is the layer where data is generated by the user or an application. The data is passed down to the transport layer for further processing.

Transport layer: This layer is responsible for breaking down data into smaller packets and ensuring that they are reliably delivered. The two main protocols used at this layer are TCP and UDP.

Network layer: This layer adds an IP header to each packet, which contains information such as the source and destination addresses. This layer is responsible for routing packets across different networks.

Data link layer: This layer uses a MAC to generate the frames that will be transmitted. When transmitting data, this layer adds a header containing the source and destination MAC addresses to the packet recieved from the Network layer.

Physical layer: This layer sends and receives signals on the physical wire or antenna to transmits the bits found in frames.
